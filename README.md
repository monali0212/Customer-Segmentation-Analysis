# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This analysis helps businesses understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies to target specific groups effectively. The project leverages clustering techniques to identify distinct customer segments.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral data using unsupervised learning techniques. The analysis aims to:
- Identify unique customer segments.
- Understand the characteristics of each segment.
- Provide actionable insights to improve marketing and business strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains the following features:
- **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender:** Male or Female.
- **Age:** Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$):** Annual income in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100):** A score assigned by the mall based on customer spending and behavior.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Programming language used for analysis.
- **Libraries:**
  - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn:** For implementing clustering algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle):** Environment for coding and documentation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   - Normalize or scale features for clustering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize data distributions.
   - Analyze relationships between features.

3. **Clustering Techniques:**
   - Implement **K-Means Clustering** to identify customer segments.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.

4. **Visualization of Clusters:**
   - Plot customer segments to understand their characteristics visually.

5. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Derive business insights from the identified clusters.

## Results
- The clustering analysis identified distinct customer segments based on their income, age, and spending habits.
- Key insights include:
  - High spenders with high income.
  - Low spenders with low income.
  - Younger customers with moderate spending scores.

## Recommendations
- Tailor marketing campaigns for high-income, high-spending customers to maximize ROI.
- Provide offers and loyalty programs to engage low-income groups.
- Focus on younger segments with targeted promotions to build brand loyalty.

## Future Work
- Use additional features, such as transaction history, to refine segmentation.
- Experiment with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- Incorporate customer feedback data for a more holistic analysis.
